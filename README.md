Case study for data engineering roles. Azure, SQL, data modelling, MDM.
This repository documents case study aimed at data engineering roles, underscoring the utilization of Azure, SQL, data modeling, and Master Data Management (MDM) to solve a real-world business challenge. The case study is rooted in a practical scenario faced in December 2023, demanding the creation of reporting system for inventory management during the holiday season. Presented contributions are the result of the author's direct engagement with the case study, showcasing a tailored approach to solving the unique data engineering challenges encountered

Datasets: 3 datasets:
1.	Large Transaction Data (Millions of records), refreshed Hourly. Source: On-premise SFTP folder
2.	Product Data Source: Azure Synapse Analytics DB
3.	Calendar Data Source: Excel file provided by the Business

There are five questions for this case study:
1. How would you bring these datasets together into a data warehouse? Feel free to put together a diagram flow to illustrate your thinking.
2. How would you clean the data and make it ready for analysis?
3. How would you merge and summarize the data to help answer the business question? You are encouraged to write out a simple query in SQL, R, Python or any other type of code or language. 4. How would you optimize this database query for better performance? How would you troubleshoot performance issues?
5. What considerations would you put in place to ensure data accuracy and clear data versioning?
